# avr_build
Small shell script to build avr toolchain


## Motivation

I wanted to build a toolchain that has support for the new AVR-Dx devices

## Usage

You may edit the file the set new git hashes, but pretty much all you have to do
is run the script. The script will fail if any of the dendencies are missing.

## Origin

This script was originally written by Zak Kemble (https://blog.zakkemble.net/avr-gcc-builds/), but was heavily 
modified.
